# Futuristic Airbnb - Exploring in London

Airbnb is a vacation rental platform where the user can rent a home for tourism experiences. User can also list their properties in Airbnb for renting it out. Airbnb can see an exponential increase in the number of rentals listed on their platform every year. The platform has attracted more people with their home friendly services and hospitality. Thus, feels like staying in a home even on a vacation.

London is the most popular place having around 76534 listings as of December 16, 2020. Around 40% of their listings with the entire home types are being rented out to the tourists for more than 90 days term. On an average term, Airbnb guests stay for around an average of 4.5 nights in London.

The main purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize the Airbnb dataset. Our investigation will help us to determine the factors for the success of Airbnb business; places to explore for the hosts to expand the Airbnb business; covid impacts on Airbnb; listings managed by the hosts; Renting prices based on the accommodates; judging the host response rate; forecasting/predicting the listing price over the time, etc. To visually analyze the data, we will be creating an interactive dashboard & stories using Tableau. This dashboard will be helpful for the user to find a better accommodation based on customer satisfaction & requirements. And, will also help in improving the Airbnb business based on certain factors in London.
